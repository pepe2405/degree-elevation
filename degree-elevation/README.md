## Degree Elevation
Degree Elevation is an interactive application designed to illustrate and perform the process of degree elevation on Bézier curves. The tool allows users to input and adjust control points, visualize the original Bézier curve, and then see how the curve transforms when its degree is elevated. This process is fundamental in computer graphics and computational geometry, ensuring that the shape of a curve remains unchanged even as its polynomial degree increases.

## Features
Interactive Visualization:
Dynamically view the Bézier curve before and after degree elevation, with real-time updates as you adjust control points.

## Customizable Control Points:
Easily add, remove, or modify control points to experiment with different curve shapes and see the impact on the degree elevation process.

## Mathematical Insights:
Display the underlying formulas and derivations used during the degree elevation process, making it a great learning tool for students and educators.

## User-Friendly Interface:
Designed with simplicity in mind to cater to beginners as well as professionals in the fields of computer graphics and design.
